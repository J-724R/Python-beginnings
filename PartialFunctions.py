# similar to currying function in js

from functools import partial

def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y

# create a new function that multiplies by 2
dbl = partial(multiply, 2)
print(dbl(4))


# ! Exercise
# Edit the function provided by calling partial() and
#  replacing the first three variables in func(). Then
#  print with the new partial function using only one input 
# variable so that the output equals 60.


#Following is the exercise, function provided:
from functools import partial
def func(u, v, w, x):
    return u*4 + v*3 + w*2 + x
#Enter your code here to create and print with your partial function
foo = partial(func,4,4,4)
print(foo(4))
